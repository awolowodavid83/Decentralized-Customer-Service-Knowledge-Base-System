# Decentralized Customer Service Knowledge Base System

## Overview

A decentralized knowledge management system built on Stacks blockchain that enables organizations to create, manage, and optimize customer service knowledge bases through smart contracts.

## System Architecture

The system consists of five interconnected smart contracts:

### 1. Knowledge Curator Verification Contract (`curator-verification.clar`)
- Validates and manages knowledge curators
- Handles curator registration and reputation scoring
- Manages curator permissions and access levels

### 2. Content Management Contract (`content-management.clar`)
- Manages knowledge articles and content
- Handles content creation, updates, and versioning
- Manages content categories and tagging

### 3. Search Optimization Contract (`search-optimization.clar`)
- Optimizes knowledge search functionality
- Manages search indexing and ranking algorithms
- Handles search query processing and results

### 4. Usage Analytics Contract (`usage-analytics.clar`)
- Tracks knowledge base usage patterns
- Analyzes user interactions and content performance
- Generates usage reports and insights

### 5. Content Improvement Contract (`content-improvement.clar`)
- Manages content quality and improvement processes
- Handles feedback collection and processing
- Manages content review and approval workflows

## Key Features

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Deploy contracts using Clarinet
4. Initialize system with admin functions

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests using Vitest:
- Unit tests for each contract function
- Integration tests for contract interactions
- Edge case and error handling tests

## Configuration

- `Clarinet.toml`: Clarinet configuration
- `package.json`: Node.js dependencies and scripts
- Test files in `/tests` directory
